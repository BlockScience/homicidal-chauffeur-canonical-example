The Homicidal Chauffeur Problem is a classic differential game where an agile pedestrian (evader) tries to escape from a fast but less maneuverable car (pursuer). This problem is often analyzed using control theory and dynamical systems.

Dynamical System Representation
The system consists of two agents:
- Pursuer (Chauffeur/Car): Moves with a fixed speed $v_C$ and has a turning radius constraint.
- Evader (Pedestrian): Moves more slowly $\left(v_P\right)$ but can change direction instantly.

Let's define the state of the system:

$$
\mathbf{x}=\left(x_C, y_C, \theta_C, x_P, y_P\right)
$$

where:
- $\left(x_C, y_C\right)$ is the car's position,
- $\theta_C$ is the car's heading angle,
- $\left(x_P, y_P\right)$ is the pedestrian's position.

Equations of Motion
1. Car (Pursuer) Dynamics (nonholonomic constraint, fixed-speed turning)

$$
\begin{gathered}
\dot{x}_C=v_C \cos \left(\theta_C\right) \\
\dot{y}_C=v_C \sin \left(\theta_C\right) \\
\dot{\theta}_C=u_C
\end{gathered}
$$

where $u_C$ is the control input for turning rate.
2. Pedestrian (Evader) Dynamics (unconstrained movement)

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{x}_P & =v_P \cos \left(\theta_P\right) \\
\dot{y}_P & =v_P \sin \left(\theta_P\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\theta_P$ is the pedestrian's instantaneous heading direction.

Epoch in a Simulation
One epoch in this context could correspond to a time step $\Delta t$ in a discrete simulation. Within this epoch:
1. The pedestrian picks an optimal escape direction based on the chauffeur's position and heading.
2. The chauffeur updates its control $u_C$ to minimize the escape trajectory of the pedestrian.
3. Both agents update their states according to their respective dynamics.

This process repeats iteratively until:
- The car reaches the pedestrian $(d \leq \epsilon)$.
- The pedestrian reaches a safe zone (if defined).
